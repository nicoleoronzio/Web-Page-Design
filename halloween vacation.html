		<h1 id="top">Panda Travel Agency's Halloween Vacation at Clinton Road West Milford, New Jersey</h1>
		<hr />
		<body>
		Clinton Road is in West Milford, New Jersey. It is a dark and scary road that is almost ten
		miles long. It runs in a North-South direction going from Route 23 near Newfoundland 
		all of the way to Upper Greenwood Lake. This place is known for its paranormal experiences
		and the feelings that people get when entering and driving down this road. A few conspiracies the
		locals have are that you will see or experience ghost like phenomenons and possibly
		the Jersey devil, a big legend in the surrounding areas and near by states.

		<p>Reasons Why You Should Go Here:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It is something that can and will give you a great spook</li>
		<li>There are abandoned homes with danger signs on them. This will make your mind 
		think of what could be in them.</li>
		<li>If you go back in the day time, you can read up about the history of the road after you were on it during the night</li>
	</ul>
		
		<p>Things To Do On the Road For Creepy Experiences:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you stop at the dead man's bridge, sit on it, and throw pennies in, supposedly
		a little boy will throw pennies back at you.</li>
		<li>Legend has it that a little boy was picking up a quater on the road and he was
		 hit and killed. If you see a quater on the dead man's bridge and you go to pick it up
		 the little boy will push you into the water.</li>
		 <li>If you leave a quater by the bridge, you may have the ghost throw the quater 
		 either at you or against your car window.</li>
