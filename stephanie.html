    	    <h5>Early Life</h5>
    	   <p class="p2">Stephanie Kwolek was born by Polish immigrant parents, John and Nellie 
    	   Kwolek in New Kensington, PA (a Pittsburgh suburb) on July 31, 1923. John was 
    	   a naturalist by avocation and while Stephanie was young, he would often explore 
    	   the natural world with her.  In her early years, she would express her love for 
    	   science and fashion to her parents as well. John ended up dying when Kwolek 
    	   was just at the age of 10. After highschool in 1946, she went to <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" 
    	   target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a> and received a Bachelor of Science.</p>
    	   <h5>After College</h5>
    	   <p class="p2">Soon after receiving her Bachelor's degree, Hale Church offered Kwolek a position 
    	   at the <a href="http://www.dupont.com/corporate-functions/our-company.html" 
    	   target="_blank">Dupont</a> in Buffalo, New York. This was only an opportunity for her because 
    	   of World War II, a time where a very large number of men were gone fighting 
    	   for their country. Kwolek originally wanted to only work at DuPont temporarily, 
    	   but left her dream of a medical career to work there permanently in the chemistry 
    	   field. In 1950, she moved to Wilmington, DE to work for the DuPont there.</p>
    	   <h5>Greatest Accomplishment</h5>
    	   <p class="p2">Due to an anticipation of gasoline shortage in 1964, her group at DuPont 
    	   started a search for a lightweight, yet strong, fiber that can be used in tires.
    	   Her first attempt was close to what she wanted, but was not it. The first 
    	   material was weak and made from less stiff fibers. She explained that the 
    	   solution was “unusually (low viscosity), turbid, stir-opalescent and buttermilk 
    	   in appearance.” Then she went on to say that conventional polymer solutions 
    	   should not appear like this and should be translucent. She later on found out 
    	   that this solution was a liquid crystalline solution. The solution was usually 
    	   thrown away, but one day Kwolek convinced Charles Smullen, the running of the 
    	   spinneret and a technician, to test her solution. Upon  testing it, it was 
    	   discovered that this fiber would not break in the same conditions that Nylon 
    	   typically would. It was also five times stronger than steel by weight. Her 
    	   supervisor and laboratory director knew the significance of this discovery so 
    	   they started a new field called polymer chemistry. By 1971, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevlar" 
    	   target="_blank">Kevlar</a> was introduced and soon, Kwolek learned that the fibers 
			could be made even stronger with heat</p>

    	    <h5>1955</h5>
    	    <p>Dupont comany’s Lavoisier Medal for being a "Persistent 
    	    experimentalist and role model whose discovery of liquid crystalline polyamides 
    	    led to Kevlar aramid fibers." As of 2014, she was the only female to receive that award</p>
    	    <h5>1980</h5>
